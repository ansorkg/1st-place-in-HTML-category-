        <p><strong>I begin in the name of Allah, the Most Gracious and the Most Merciful (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)
         </strong><br>Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam. Fasting was made obligatory for Muslims in the second year of the Hijra. The month of Ramadan is a blessed and blessed month for Muslims, and all Muslims fast during this blessed month. The lexical meaning of the word “fasting” means “to abstain from something, to refrain from something, to be careful.” The meaning of fasting in Sharia is “to abstain from things that break the fast, namely, eating and drinking and sexual intercourse with the wife of one’s marriage, with the specific intention of those who have reached puberty, from dawn to sunset.” Fasting during the month of Ramadan is obligatory for every adult, sane, and settled Muslim. Young children, the sick, and travelers do not fast. However, travelers are advised to fast. Also, women who are menstruating or bleeding from childbirth do not fast until their bleeding stops. After Ramadan, they make up the days of fasting. Fasting reminds Muslims of Allah Almighty and awakens their responsibility. Allah Almighty has made fasting obligatory for humans to purify their inner world, to be characterized by good character, to have good relations with others, and to be pious. By fasting, a Muslim protects his eyes from looking at forbidden things, his ears from hearing forbidden things, his tongue from speaking falsely, his stomach from eating forbidden food, his hands from doing wrong things, and his feet from going to forbidden places. He always feels that Allah Almighty is watching and knowing.</p>

    <p><strong>Allah Almighty says about fasting in the Holy Qur'an:</strong>
    قال الله تعالي: » يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُون أَيَّامًا مَّعْدُودَاتٍ فَمَن كَانَ مِنكُم مَّرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ  وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ يُطِيقُونَهُ فِدْيَةٌ طَعَامُ مِسْكِينٍ  فَمَن تَطَوَّعَ خَيْرًا فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ ۚ وَأَن تَصُومُوا خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ ۖ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ  شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِّنَ الْهُدَىٰ وَالْفُرْقَانِ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ  وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ  يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا الْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَاكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ (البقرة(183 -185)</p>
    <p>Allah Almighty says: “O you who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may become righteous. (Fasting) is only for a specified number of days. But if any of you is sick or on a journey, then he should make up for those days. And those who cannot fast, then he should feed the poor. And whoever does more than that, it is better for himself. Fasting is best for you, if you only knew.</p>

<h3>We are the only country in the world that offers Eid prayers in the square.</h3>

    <p><strong>We present Abibilla Aji Kadyrberdiev's statement in its entirety, without any changes.</strong></p>
    <p>"If the Eid prayer is not performed in squares or mosques, it is not prescribed in the Sharia, or rather in the Hanafi school of thought, for everyone to perform it independently at home. This is because there are a number of conditions for performing the Eid and Friday prayers. Let us mention some of them:</p>
    <p>“Iznul aam” - Muslims must enter the place where the Eid or Friday prayer is performed without any hindrance. However, when it is performed in homes, no one else can enter someone’s home without any hindrance. Therefore, this condition is not found in the permission for the Eid or Friday prayer to be performed at home.</p>
    <p>As for other prayers performed instead of the Eid prayer, basically instead of the Eid prayer, There is no prayer that can be performed, or rather, that can replace the prayer, which can be performed in the same way as the one who performed the Eid prayer itself, and can be forgiven for the debt. It is correct that Abdullah ibn Mas’ud (may Allah be pleased with him) said:</p>
    <p><strong>وروى الطبراني في: "الكبير"، عن الشعبي قال: قَالَ عَبْدُ اللهِ بْنُ مَسْعُودٍ: «مَنْ فَاتَهُ الْعِيدُ فَلْيُصَلِّ أَرْبَعًا». ورجاله ثقات كما في: "مجمع الزوائد". </strong> <br>
        “Whoever misses the Eid prayer, let him pray four rak’ahs.” Imam Tabarani narrated in his book “Al-Kabeer” from Al-Shaabi.</p>
